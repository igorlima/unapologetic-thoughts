title: GPT - A step closer to AGI?
category: sketch
---

Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is the representation of generalized human cognitive abilities in software so that, faced with an unfamiliar task, the AGI system could find a solution.

By showing LLMs videos, images, and text, machines learn language skills with text-based descriptions, and perception skills with images. [^1]

This can elevate AI to a place where it learns to perceive emotions and sentiment the same way humans do and, eventually, learn to understand human communication better than actual humans.


_Understanding the beast behind_

Neural networks are stupidly simple to understand for anyone with a mild knowledge of statistics and calculus.

At the end of the day, they simply measure the gap between the value they predict and the value they should have predicted and close that gap using undergrad-level mathematics.

While AGI models will surely be multimodal, thereâ€™s an unbridgeable barrier to this day: humans learn emotions by experiencing them, while machines learn emotions through textual or visual representations of what those emotions are.
