Conjunctions link phrases or clauses together. Without conjunctions, the English language would sound like it was created by a bunch of robots. [^1]
- Without conjunctions:
  - _I am hungry. I am tired. I will sit down. I will eat._
- With conjunctions:
  - _I am tired and hungry, so I will sit down and eat._
