title: GPT - A step closer to AGI?
category: sketch
---

Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is the representation of generalized human cognitive abilities in software so that, faced with an unfamiliar task, the AGI system could find a solution.

By showing LLMs videos, images, and text, machines learn language skills with text-based descriptions, and perception skills with images. [^1]

This can elevate AI to a place where it learns to perceive emotions and sentiment the same way humans do and, eventually, learn to understand human communication better than actual humans.


__Understanding the beast behind__

Neural networks are stupidly simple to understand for anyone with a mild knowledge of statistics and calculus.

At the end of the day, they simply measure the gap between the value they predict and the value they should have predicted and close that gap using undergrad-level mathematics.

While AGI models will surely be multimodal, thereâ€™s an unbridgeable barrier to this day: humans learn emotions by experiencing them, while machines learn emotions through textual or visual representations of what those emotions are.


__Structured Data vs Unstructured Data__

Structured data refers to data that can be organized into a formatted repository, typically a database. Such data can be stored in database tables with rows and columns. They have relational keys and can easily be mapped into pre-designed fields. Typical structured data include relational databases such as PostgreSQL, Snowflake data warehouse, etc. [^2]

Unstructured data refers to data that is not organized in a predefined manner or does not have a predefined data model. Thus, it is not a good fit for a mainstream relational database. Unstructured data is increasingly prevalent in IT systems and is used by organizations in various business intelligence and analytics applications. Examples include YouTube videos, audio files, Word, PDF, Text, and media logs.



__Dictionary & Acronym__

- NLP: natural language processing
- LLM: Large Language Model is a type of machine learning model that can perform a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including generating and classifying text, answering questions in a conversational manner and translating text from one language to another.
