- Sometimes caring a lot can cause you to give too much of yourself.
- Sometimes one person is the glue that holds things together. But that's not sustainable.
- You can't get emotional support from someone who is focused on themselves.
- You can't get love from someone who doesn't know how to love themselves.
- Don't chase after someone who isn't willing to chase after you. At least not for too long.
  - [Equally, don't give up on someone who doesn't give up on you.]
