Mistakes Killing Your Second Brain: [^1]
- The collector's conundrum: You become a curator of other people's ideas, not your own. [^2]
- This is a thinking problem: Avoiding the hard work of critical thinking, drafting, and shaping ideas.

Notes are only valuable if they're acted upon. A "Second Brain" is meaningless without the hard work of critical thinking.

Simply collecting and organizing information is not enough; one must think critically and use the information to create something new.

Stop archiving and start creating.

Start with the basics. Know what you are working on. Not next month or next quarter, but this week. Be specific. Then make your notes work harder.
Instead of just capturing quotes or links, add your own thoughts.

Summarize in your own words. Challenge the source. Push back and pull ideas apart.

In the end, your notes only matter if they help you create. They only matter if you use them to think more clearly or to say something worth sharing. Collecting information is easy. Doing something with it is not. But that is the part that matters.

The point is not to have more notes. The point is to use them. That is where real progress begins.
