Our brains can actually become addicted to __productivity__. “A person might crave the recognition their work gives them, or the salary increases they get.” “The problem is that just like all addictions, over time a person needs more and more to be satisfied and then it starts to work against you.”

- understand your emotions
- care for your mind and body
