**Reality is an interpretation.** "There are no facts, only interpretations,” wrote philosopher Nietzsche.

We don't see the world as it is. We see it as we are. The truth is not that simple. It's subject to interpretation. It changes with perspective.

Essayist Anaïs Nin also noted, “You don't see things as they are, you see them as you are."

Reality's a crowd of stories fighting for attention. The loudest wins.

Failure isn't the problem; believing failure is permanent is. [^1]

The issue isn't failure itself, but believing failure is permanent.
