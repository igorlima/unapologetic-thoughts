Every day, in every interaction, you're teaching people how to treat you, whether you realize it or noy. [^1]

You set the standard for how others behave toward you by what you tolerate, what you reinforce, and what you ignore.

If you don't define who you are and what you stand for, people will decide for you-and often, in ways that diminish your worth.

__Your Time Is Valuable-Act Like It__

Time is not money. It's far more precious than that. Money can be regained; time cannot.

Yet, people will try to waste yours without a second thought.
If you don't guard your time, others will treat it as if it belongs to them.

Teach people that your time is not free. If they want it, they need to bring something valuable in return-whether it's respect, reciprocity, or a purpose that aligns with your own.

Stop living for approval. Speak your truth. Stand your ground.

The right people will see you clearly. The wrong ones were never meant to understand you in the first place.

__Silence Is Not Weakness-It's a Weapon__

But in reality, silence is often the most powerful response. Why? Because it denies the other person control.

__Not Everyone Deserves Access to You__

Some people assume that just because they want your attention, they should have it. That just because they demand your energy, you should give it. But access to you is a privilege, not a right.

You're not obligated to entertain every conversation, engage with every critic, or be available at all times.
