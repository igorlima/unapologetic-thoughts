When it’s easier, you do it more. Or do you?

If you get home gym equipment and cancel your gym membership, you might find you work out less.

The “pool table paradox” [^1] is the paradox that sometimes when it’s more convenient, it’s harder to do.

As most people who have had a pool table know, pool tables are lots of fun when you’re at a bar or a friend’s house. But then you buy a pool table, thinking you’ll play all the time. Somehow, you never do. Sometimes, by making it a little harder to do, you do it more.
