1. Inhale deeply through your nose for 4 seconds.
2. Hold your breath for 4 seconds.
3. Exhale through pursed lips for 4 seconds.

    - Precision Timing: 4-second intervals sync with the natural cardiac rhythm.
  - Cognitive Anchors: Words like "safe/still/strong" occupy working memory, crowding out panic.
  - Lengthened exhales activate the parasympathetic nervous system, lowering the heart rate.
    - Vagus Nerve Activation: Lengthened exhales trigger parasympathetic relaxation, lowering heart rate by 20-30 BPM.
- Debunking Myths
  - You don't need hours of meditation; 16 seconds of this breathing trick resets your nervous system.
  - You don't need a quiet space; it can be used anywhere.
