As ideas grow and expand, with notes scattered here and there, finding a central point to anchor everything and connect the pieces makes a difference.

<sup>The focus initially started on dates, much like a journal, and I still like the idea of using dates (they serve a purpose). However, I now need one central anchor to tie everything together, something that connects all the dots spread across different dates.</sup>

<sup><sup>This central hub reminds me of the "Resources" in the PARA method [^1] [^2] â€” like the core resource of journaling bullets. From that central anchor, connections can spread through the dates, much like nutrients flowing from a root to nourish the leaves.</sup></sup>
