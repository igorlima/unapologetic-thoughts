These notes are helpers for sparking creativity! They make it easy to find and see what I've jotted down before to connect random ideas and foster new insights.

  - What annoys us about other people often points to what we dislike about ourselves. Understanding what we dislike about ourselves is just as important for self-awareness as understanding what we like.
  - Ask for Targeted Feedback
    - Think of an aspect of your personality or behavior you'd like to be more self-aware about.
      - Ask people for specific feedback about you and your behavior in that situation. For example: Instead of asking your manager _How am I doing at work?_ try __I'm working on getting better at presenting in group situations. Do you have any feedback for me specifically on how I deliver presentations with our leadership team?__ Note that keeping the feedback domain-specific and behavioral in nature makes it much less threatening for the other person to give you honest feedback.

  - Quote: "The meaning of life is the experience of life," Michael Singer. Core Idea: Life isn't about achieving, fixing, or accumulating; it's about living and experiencing.

  - __Shane Parrish__ on Procrastination: "Today, not tomorrow. What you avoid today is harder to do tomorrow. Today’s choices become tomorrow’s position. Don't wait till tomorrow; it's where dreams go to die."
    - __Today, Not Tomorrow__: Shane Parrish says, _"Today, not tomorrow. What you avoid today is harder to do tomorrow. Today's choices become tomorrow's position."_
    - __Act today, not tomorrow__. Shane Parrish emphasizes the importance of immediate action to avoid future burdens. Procrastination only adds to the list of tasks.

  - Facts About Human Behavior
    - People Believe What They Already Believe, Even If It’s Wrong
      - Facts don’t change minds; feelings do. People decide first and justify later.
    - The More Choices You Offer, The Less People Decide
      - Too many options can overwhelm people. If you want them to choose, then simplify. Less is more.
    - Always Give Someone a Way Out, Saving Face Defuses Disagreements
      - No one likes being proven wrong. Give them a non-humiliating exit route, allowing them to rethink and change their mind without feeling embarrassed.
    - Criticism Lands Better When Wrapped in Praise
      - A compliment before and after makes feedback feel like advice instead of an attack.

  - Life isn't about figuring it all out–it's about letting yourself feel it all. That's the experience. That's the gift. That's the meaning.

  - “The activist is not the man who says the river is dirty. The activist is the man who cleans up the river.” _by Ross Perot_

  - The Magic of Starting Small
    - __1-minute micro habits__ are so easy to do that they automatically eliminate our stupid excuses like “I don’t have time” or “It’s too hard.”
    - It doesn't have to push yourself, and it seemed so easy to your brain that you couldn’t find an excuse to skip it.
      - "It felt effortless because I wasn’t forcing the changes — they happened organically."
      - "One of the biggest lessons I’ve learned is that consistency matters more than intensity."

  - bizarre psychology fact that may change how we see people
    - people will judge us based on their mood, not logic
  - our brains are forgetting machines
    - this is a concept from Quiroga's book "The Forgetting Machine"
    - there explains why remembering everything woulb be energetically and computationally impossible/expensive for our brains
    - why we can't remember everything we study? __because__ we don't link informtion from __short-term__ to __long-term__ memory <a href="#2000a10m01d-20001001212101">§</a> <a id="2025a02m27d-20250301045437"></a>

  - When rewarding the candor, it is more likely to get more of it.
  - Did you like what the colleague have done? Thanks them in public. Let them know. Both gain in this win-win game. It shows gratitude. Also, and a thankful word is a fuel to keep a good habit last.
