Being busy is not an excuse for being disorganized. [^1]

Just collecting info is not thinking - pieces of info need to be connected and combined. [^2]

Ask more insightful questions each time I made a note. Similar to:
- “Why does this matter?”
- “What does this connect to?”
- “How can this help Future Me?”

The Dirty Truth: You’re Not Too Busy, You’re Just Disorganized.

If you feel like you’re always busy, out of ideas, or “too busy to think,” you probably don’t have any free time. You’re simply not in the proper sequence.

You have too much on your head, and it’s driving you crazy. You’re working more slowly because you keep looking for the same information. Your material is subpar, as it’s shallow, disconnected, and derivative.

Getting more done isn’t as simple as getting more coffee or using another productivity tip. The answer is to get your thoughts out of your head in a manner that makes it easy to find and connect with things.

Every time you save anything, ask yourself, “Why does this matter?” What if it doesn’t? Throw it away.

Check in often. Your system is working. Give it food. Cut it back. Use it.

Check in often. Your system is working. Give it food. Cut it back. Use it.

Stop gathering. Start making connections. And see how quickly your thoughts take shape.

The core argument is that organizing notes is not just about neatness but about creating a "live thought system" that connects ideas and facilitates deeper thinking.

By asking insightful questions about each note's relevance and connections, using a single note-taking app, and focusing on the habit of connecting thoughts rather than just saving them.

The key is not to gather more information but to utilize the knowledge already possessed by connecting and organizing it effectively.
