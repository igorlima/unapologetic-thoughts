"Fear of missing out is not a valid argument for trashing what you already have,"

Reflections on TikTok's Purpose: [^1]
- Not for Networking: Unlike legacy social media, TikTok does not revolve around following friends or posting updates about one's life.
- Anonymous Consumption: According to Pew Research, the typical TikTok user never adds information to their account's "bio" field, happy to remain an anonymous consumer of content.
- Lack of Shared Experiences: Unlike platforms like X (formerly Twitter), TikTok and similar services do not foster collective conversation; feeds are highly personalized.
- Content Nature: The content on TikTok is brief, emotionally raw, and often lacks a clear purpose or connection to real-world benefits or networking.
- Reflection: Newport reflects on the shift in social media dynamics from platforms fostering community and career benefits to ones providing quick, often meaningless entertainment, highlighting a trend towards nihilism in digital content consumption.
