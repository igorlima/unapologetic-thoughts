Reflect as you go: After completing an activity, pause for a moment to reflect on how it made you feel. Consider writing a quick note in your journal or sharing your experience with someone close.

Stay flexible: No pressure! This is meant to inspire — not to stress out. Pick and choose what resonates with you, and skip what doesn’t. [^1]
