title: Get your work recognized - write a brag document
category: speaking
---

If you don’t remember everything important you did, your manager (no matter how
great they are!) probably doesn’t either. And they need to explain to other
people why you should be promoted or given an evaluation like “exceeds
expectations” (“X’s work is so awesome!!!!” doesn’t fly). [^1]

So if your manager is going to effectively advocate for you, they need help.

Maintain a “brag document” that lists everything so you can refer to it when
you get to performance review season!

Brag documents are good when you use them on your own to advocate for yourself.

One thing to emphasize, for people who don’t like to brag, is – __you don’t have
to try to make your work sound better than it is__. Just make it sound exactly as
good as it is! For example “was the primary contributor to X new feature that’s
now used by 60% of our customers and has gotten Y positive feedback”. [^1]

## Template

- Goals for this year:
  - List your major goals here! Sharing your goals with your manager &
    coworkers is really nice because it helps them see how they can support you
    in accomplishing those goals!
- Goals for next year
  - If it’s getting towards the end of the year, maybe start writing down what
    you think your goals for next year might be.
- Projects
  - For each one, go through:
    - _What your contributions were (did you come up with the design? Which
      components did you build? Was there some useful insight like “wait, we
      can cut scope and do what we want by doing way less work” that you came
      up with?)_
    - _The impact of the project – who was it for? Are there numbers you can
      attach to it? (saved X dollars? shipped new feature that has helped sell
      Y big deals? Improved performance by X%? Used by X internal users every
      day?). Did it support some important non-numeric company goal (required
      to pass an audit? helped retain an important user?)_

## Outside of work

It’s also often useful to track accomplishments outside of work, like:
- blog posts
- talks/panels
- open source work
- industry recognition

## General prompts

If you’re feeling stuck for things to mention, try:
- If you were trying to convince a friend to come join your company/team, what would you tell them about your work?
- Did anybody tell you that you did something well recently?
