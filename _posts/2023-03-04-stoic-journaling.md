The goal is to cultivate a more mindful and intentional approach to life by reflecting on oneâ€™s thoughts, actions, and emotions. [^1]

Stoic journaling, a form of contemplative writing, is a powerful tool for self-reflection and personal growth.

Stoic journaling encourages stoics to take a few moments each day to look inward and reflect on their current situation, feelings, and emotions.

Regularly journaling allows Stoics to be honest with themselves, reflect on the past, and plan for the future.

Setting aside time each day or week for reflective writing is typically recommended, and approaching it with a clear and focused mindset.

__*The first step is identifying any negative or irrational thoughts affecting your mood or behaviour.*__
