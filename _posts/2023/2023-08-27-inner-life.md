Not having something to do, doesn’t have to feel like a waste of time. Use the time to be mindful. You might learn something. Even if you don’t learn anything, you’ll feel more at peace. [^1]

__Nobody can give you the inner peace you need.__ No job can do it. No amount of money can do it. Making the right choices in these areas can help, but they don’t get you all the way there. It’s a place within you that you need to go to. [^1]
