  - When your primary goal is to be liked, you can't take risks. You can't disagree. You can't push boundaries. You become a prisoner of other people's expectations.

  - AI degrades over time due to the loss of context and its inability to fill gaps in unstructured data.
    - AI models are based on unstructured data, which is prone to degradation over time.
    - By understanding these limitations and approaches, users can better leverage AI to achieve their goals without encountering unwanted outcomes.
    - A key issue is that AI degrades data over time due to limitations in context window size and the difficulty of capturing all contextual details.

  - Core mindset shifts that help to go from burned out to bulletproof, including prioritizing clarity over hustle, cutting down on inputs, and designing environments that trigger focus.
    - These mindset shifts can help with burnout and improve productivity.
      - Time management is a trap. It assumes every hour is equal. It's not. Upgrade: Track your energy curve.
      - "If you don't know what game you're playing, you'll always feel behind."
      - We don't lack information–we drown in it.
      - You don't need better focus. You need fewer distractions.
      - "The most powerful story is the one you tell yourself when no one's watching."
      - Want better strategy, leadership, or clarity? Start with hydration, movement, and sleep. They're not "health tips"–they're performance systems.
    - Other key takeaways include the importance of self-talk, creating decision templates, and tracking energy levels to optimize productivity.

  - Simple one liners out of complicated truths.
    - "The Big Money Is Not in the Buying and Selling, but in the Waiting.”
    - "You Don't Have to Be Smarter Than the Rest; You Have to Be More Disciplined Than the Rest."
- Tue, Sep 02, 2025 - 2025a09m02d 
  - Respond with Stories, Not Statements.
    - One of the biggest reasons someone runs out of things to say is they give dead-end answers.
      - Instead, turn even the most boring questions into opportunities for connection.
- Mon, Sep 01, 2025 - 2025a09m01d 
  - Sensations are a quick, easy, effective way to change your mood.
    - I’m talking about music. About movement. About the minor miracle of biting into something that tastes like happiness compressed into carbohydrate form.
  - How to increase emotional intelligence...
    - Sensation: The song, the walk, the mango, the dog. They bring you back to your body, back to the moment, back to a baseline of sanity.
- Mon, Sep 01, 2025 - 2025a09m01d 
  - Behaviors, such as routine, contemplation, humility, and gratitude, are rational and beneficial for individuals and society as a whole, regardless of belief in a higher power.
    - Foundational behaviors common to dominant religions, such as routine, contemplation, humility, gratitude, accountability, compassion, sobriety, and judiciousness, are beneficial for individuals and society, regardless of religious belief.

  - Weird but Strangely Effective Tips for Life
    - _**Invest in the things that keep you off the ground—beds, chairs, shoes.**_
    - Be a good person, but don’t waste your time trying to prove it.
    - If you’re the smartest one in the room, find a new room.
    - **Never forget, you can be right - or you can be happy.**
- Sun, Aug 31, 2025 - 2025a08m31d 
  - **First And Foremost:** Address basic needs (hunger, tiredness, overstimulation) before anything else. Biology > Psychology.
  - Give information instead of orders (e.g., "The iPad is very delicate" instead of "Don't be so rough!").
  - Use "I" not "you" (e.g., "I'd like it if those toys were cleaned up").
  - _These strategies won't eliminate all challenges, but they can reduce stress and improve the parent-child relationship._

  - **The One Who Wins Every Argument Often Loses the People Around Them**
    - Imagine a man is always right. Razor sharp. Every conversation is a duel he must win.
    - To value victory over connection is to walk alone.
    - To silence others with your brilliance is to invite silence into your own life.
    - Winning arguments often loses relationships.
    - An argument is about belonging, not truth.
    - Marcus Aurelius: be right and kind if possible. If you must choose, choose kindness. An argument is never about truth.
    - You can be right, and you can be kind. Choose both if possible. If not, choose kind.—Marcus Aurelius
    - Winning isn't worth it if it costs the people who matter.
  - Prioritizing relationships over being right
    - Winning arguments can lead to losing relationships, and it's more important to be kind and understanding.
- Sun, Aug 10, 2025 - 2025a08m10d
  - _"Everything We Hear Is an Opinion, Not a Fact. Everything We See Is a Perspective, Not the Truth.”_ We don’t see the world as it is. We see it through our own window. Two people watch the same rain. One is glad for the crops. One curses the sky. Maybe your aunt’s Facebook status is cringe for you, but not to her and her friends. You conserve enormous energy by being mindful of the difference. Half of your arguments could be avoided if you simply say, _“This is my idea, not a law for everyone.”_
  - Telling yourself you'll do it tomorrow is _**how dreams die**_.
  - People think good decision-making is about being right all the time. **It's not**. It's about lowering the cost of being wrong and changing your mind. When the cost of mistakes is high, we're paralyzed with fear. **When the cost of mistakes is low, we can move fast and adapt**. Make mistakes cheap, not rare.
- Tue, Aug 05, 2025 - 2025a08m05d 
  - Similarities between the current AI boom and the dot-com crash. Do we live in a bubble? Most likely. Is it going to burst? History says yes. When it does, will AI vanish? Not at all. Markets always correct when expectations exceed reality, not because the technology is fake or ineffective. The dot-com crash destroyed the weaker companies, an AI correction would likely have the same effect. **The issue isn't the technology - it's the timeline and expectations.**
  - _"No-Code is the New Technical Debt"._ As AI assists in every level of operations, parts of your business hidden behind other people's abstractions become blind spots. The more layers you rent from vendors, the more of your business you lose control over. <a href="#2025a08m05d-20250816081441">§</a> <a id="2025a08m05d-20250816081441"></a> <sup>[+](https://medium.com/@chrisdunlop_37984/no-code-is-the-new-technical-debt-c1160476333a)</sup> <sup>[++](https://igorlima.github.io/unapologetic-snippets/docs/algorithms-and-data-structures/ai/no-code-platform)</sup>

  - There are aspiration-driven desires, and obligation-driven desires. <sup>[+](https://kadavy.net/love-mondays/aspirations-through-obligations/)</sup>
    - Our obligations come from a sense of duty to ourselves and others.
      - We want to make money and participate in society. We want to make our families feel proud. We want to stay consistent with our identities as reliable people.
    - Our aspirations come from within.
      - We often can’t put them into words. We want to write novels, make music, and build beautiful software, or just kinda ya know, do things.
  - Aphorism: “Find what you love and let it kill you.” - Charles Bukowski
  - Acknowledging the challenges of office politics. <a href="#2025a08m04d-20250817201616">§</a> <a id="2025a08m04d-20250817201616"></a> <sup>[++]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2025/2025-08-04-office-politics %})
    - Fairness is not always a determining factor in career advancement and that having leverage, such as a higher position, access to resources, or a good reputation, can significantly impact one's career.
      - _**Understanding office politics doesn't mean you've sold your soul; it means you've bought a better map**_.
      - We need to understand this game to get ahead. I know, it's gross. But we're not here to save souls; we're here to get a raise and better health insurance.
        - You're probably not gonna like everything you read below but I don't make the rules. It's time to learn how to play the game better, how to be smarter with our behavior, and, above all, to be strategic.

  - The Distinction Most Men Miss
    - Woman is never wrong about how she feels. That's the distinction most men miss—and it's a costly one.
    - When someone tells us they're unhappy—especially someone we love—we don't hear them. We hear failure. And failure triggers fear.
    - Stop trying to be right. Start trying to connect. Because the space between "I'm right" and "Woman is wrong" is where your relationship is either quietly dying… or where it can come roaring back to life.
    - It highlights that women are never wrong about how they feel, and men often miss this distinction, leading to costly misunderstandings.
    - It emphasizes the importance of improving emotional fluency rather than following blueprints or trying to fix problems.
- Mon, Jul 21, 2025 - 2025a07m21d 
  - "The people who are right most of the time," Bezos says, "are the people who change their minds the most."
  - Bezos' leadership style emphasizes intellectual flexibility over consistency. He doesn’t view changing your mind as weakness but as a crucial success mindset.

  - Understood **reciprocity**: humans are biologically wired to return favors, even those that are unearned.

  - The same story can have different takeaways.
    - This is roughly what a mental model is: it's the lens through which you view the world.
    - Mental models matter because they help you see patterns that others don't.
  - Mental Models
    - Mental models are the lenses through which we view the world, influencing our decisions, relationships, work, and money.
    - It introduces mental models to help think like a genius: Resistance, Fosbury Flop, Antifragility, Regret Minimization Framework, The 10/1 Rule, The 5/25 Rule, Exponential Thinking, and Information Arbitrage.
    - Each model provides a unique perspective on how to approach challenges, make decisions, and grow.
      - The 10/1 Rule
        - The one that resonate to me most today.
        - Be worth ten times what you ask for.
        - The concept is easy to grasp: give 10x what you receive in exchange. Not in cash alone, in time, effort, value, surprise.
        - You are trusted by others. And trust is the only proper currency.
        - They know you. Even though they do not say so in words.
        - Being good at something is great. But being generous gets people to care.
- Sun, May 04, 2025 - 2025a05m04d
  - What separates good work from great isn't talent but persistence. The most successful people aren't those who feel motivated all the time; they're the ones who work even when they don't feel like it.

  - Creativity isn't something you have or don't have - it's something you express.

  - Paradoxes That Are True - Save Your Time
    - The More You Try to Control, the More You Lose Control
      - Ask anyone who has tried to fix a teenager. Or a spouse. Or a friend. Or a bad haircut. The more you squeeze something with urgency, the sooner it wriggles away into your palms.
    - Letting Go Often Brings You Closer
    - True Freedom Requires Structure and Limits
      - Too many choices overwhelm. Boundaries are what make freedom feel safe.
        - Boundaries bring clarity
        - Too much freedom overwhelms
      - You need boundaries as a river needs banks.
    - The Harder You Chase Happiness, the More It Eludes You
      - Pursuit leads to pressure, not peace. Focus on meaning and joy follows quietly.
    - Vulnerability Is Your Greatest Strength
    - Rest Is What Makes You Productive
    - Strength Looks Like Softness
      - Toughness protects. Softness transforms. Power isn’t force; it’s presence.
    - Growth Begins Where Certainty Ends
  - Several paradoxes that are true, focusing on personal growth, relationships, and happiness. The main points include:
    - The more you try to control things, the more you lose control.
    - Letting go and giving space can bring people closer.
    - True freedom requires structure and limits.
    - Chasing happiness can make it more elusive; instead, focus on meaningful activities.
    - Vulnerability is a strength, not a weakness.
    - Rest is essential for productivity, and burnout is not something to be proud of.
    - Strength is often associated with softness, kindness, and compassion.
    - Growth and learning occur when we are uncomfortable and uncertain.

  - The clearer you are about your priorities, the easier it is to say no.
  - The quicker you want something, the easier it is to manipulate you.
  - "To know what you are going to draw, you have to begin drawing." _Picasso_
  - Thomas Mitchell on finding happiness where we are:
    - _“People are always looking for happiness at some future time and in some new thing, or some new set of circumstances, in possession of which they some day expect to find themselves. But the fact is, if happiness is not found now, where we are, and as we are, there is little chance of it ever being found. There is a great deal more happiness around us day by day than we have the sense or the power to seek and find.”_
  - Roger Federer on the kind of talent you can practice:
    - _“Yes, talent matters. I’m not going to stand here and tell you it doesn’t. But talent has a broad definition. Most of the time, it’s not about having a gift. It’s about having grit. In tennis, like in life, discipline is also a talent. And so is patience. Trusting yourself is a talent. Embracing the process—loving the process—is a talent. Managing your life, managing yourself. These can be talents, too. Some people are born with them. Everybody has to work at them.”_
  - There are two types of truth: <sup>[+]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2025/2025-04-27-dividends-and-truth %})</sup>
    - Political truth: true because many other people think they are.
    - Technical truth: true for physical or technical reasons.
- Sun, Apr 27, 2025 - 2025a04m27d 
  - Time is not just numbers on a clock.
    - Clock Time: The hours and minutes we schedule.
      - Clock time is our method of organizing the day.
      - It's the 9-to-5 schedule, the calendar appointments, and the deadlines that matter.
      - It’s necessary for efficiency.
    - Experience Time: How I feel time passing.
      - This is subjective. It’s how time feels. An hour can fly by when you’re enjoying yourself or drag when you’re bored.
      - Henri Bergson called this “duration”—the time we live, not just measure.
      - When I’m fully engaged in an activity, like writing or better conversations, time feels different.
        - I lose track of time.
  - The book _Anti-Time Management_, Richie Norton argues that there are two ways to put time to good use now:
    - Decide who you want to be.
    - Act from that identity immediately.
- Sun, Apr 27, 2025 - 2025a04m27d 
  - "You come to understand that most people are neither for you nor against you; they are thinking about themselves.
  - You learn that no matter how hard you try to please, some people in this world are not going to love you, a lesson that is at first troubling and then really quite relaxing."
  - Most people I know or come across are not for me or against me. They are not plotting my success or downfall. They're not sitting around analyzing my choices or judging my every move. They are just thinking about themselves.
  - If someone wouldn't text back–don't wonder what you did wrong. It's not you. It's them.
  - **They will put their interests first.**
    - It's natural and a basic human instinct.
  - "It never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own." - Marcus Aurelius
  - "I am not what you think I am. You are what you think I am."-Sociologist Charles Horton Cooley's "looking-glass self" explains that quote better.
  - **People's opinions of you say more about them than they do about you.**
- Sat, Apr 26, 2025 - 2025a04m26d
  - Once you let others cross your boundaries, they'll keep doing it again and again until you are used completely for their own good.
    - Why? Because you taught them it's okay. It was your fault all along and the worst part is, you knew.
- Fri, Apr 18, 2025 - 2025a04m18d
  - We go to school primarily to learn how to be good workers, not good thinkers.
    - If you want to be different and be more than a cog in a wheel, you need to think differently from most.
- Thu, Apr 17, 2025 - 2025a04m17d
  - **People Believe What They Already Believe**, Even If It's Wrong
    - Facts don't change minds; feelings do. People decide first and justify later.
  - **Fake it till you become it.** Every great speaker was once a mess. The difference? They knew how to act as if.
      - Fake it till you make it. Even great speakers were once nervous; the difference is they learned to act confidently.
- Tue, Apr 15, 2025 - 2025a04m15d
  - Aurelius knew this 2,000 years ago: **"You suffer more in imagination than reality."**
    - Quote from Paulo Coelho: _“You drown not by falling into a river, but by staying submerged in it."_
    - "The reason people find it so hard to be happy is that they always see the past better than it was, the present worse than it is, and the future less resolved than it will be." - Marcel Pagnol
- Mon, Apr 14, 2025 - 2025a04m14d
  - The quality of our emotions is largely determined by the quality of our thinking.
  - Psychology of Forgiveness
    - Forgiveness Is Behavior, not a Feeling
    - Forgiveness from a psychological perspective is a behavior, not a feeling—it's something you do, not something that happens to you.
    - Forgiveness Is a Commitment, not an Event
    - Forgiveness Is About the Future, not the Past

  - Brain Food:
    - Everyone dreams big until they see the price tag.
    - “A man is a gregarious animal, and much more so in his mind than in his body. He may like to go alone for a walk, but he hates to stand alone in his opinions.”

  - Stop Wasting Hours
    - The problem isn't a lack of information, it's something much deeper
        - not knowing how to organize it in a way that leads to real insight or action.
    - "The biggest productivity challenge of the 21st century isn't finding information—it's managing the tsunami of data we create daily."
    - Everything feels important, but all of it competes for our mental energy.
    - The more we collect, the less we use.
        - "Without context, information is just noise."
        - We spend more time searching for information than using it.
        - Most of the tools we use to organize knowledge are designed to store information, not transform it.
    - "The goal isn't to manage information, it's to make it work for you." - Tiago Forte.

  - Brain Food
    - The loudest signals come from the emptiest sources. __Those who truly possess something rarely need to announce it__.
    - Those who fear appearing foolish rarely discover anything new. The genius of tomorrow often looks like an idiot today.
    - "Success in investing isn't about making a lot of money in a short period of time. It's about earning reasonable returns over very long periods."
- Sat, Apr 05, 2025 - 2025a04m05d 
  - Quote from Daniel Schmachtenberger:
    - "Traditional education and hyperspecialization is a way to make people subservient to the dominant paradigm/ system. Study the generalized principles of nature and be a deep generalist."
      - It's unreasonable to expect individuals to know their life's purpose or career at age 18. Society often pushes people towards a traditional path of job, marriage, and conventional life milestones, which might not suit everyone, especially those with multiple interests.
      - Individuals are not taught to think critically but to memorize and conform.
      - This system prepares individuals for replaceable roles in society, not for personal freedom or creativity.
    - The Role of AI in Specialization:
      - AI is replacing predictable, repetitive tasks, reducing the need for specialists.
      - Creative work requires taste, which AI cannot fully replicate.
    - __Role of AI__: AI can replace repetitive tasks, but true creative work involves synthesizing unique ideas, which requires human taste and experience.
  - Traditional education and hyperspecialization make people subservient to the dominant paradigm/system.
    - It's insane to think that by age 18, one should know what they want to do with their life:
      - What to study
      - What career to pursue
      - How their life will turn up
    - Most follow a path set by their parents:
      - A job-A spouse
      - A mortgage
      - A few vacations
      - A few nice dinners
      - Maybe a pet or kids
    - Yet societal pressures push you towards a "safe" route:
      - Become a doctor or lawyer
      - Get a high-paying degree
    - Society often discourages having multiple interests, labeling it as "shiny object syndrome."
    - The system was designed to create obedient workers, not thinkers, which is still reflected in today's education:
      - Students are taught to work, not think
    - Employment vs. Entrepreneurship
      - Employment : Often leads to a life of repetition, reducing the magic and challenge that drives personal growth.
      - Entrepreneurship : Offers continuous challenges, fostering growth and agency.
  - Have you ever worked with Chinese teams on global software projects?
    - It's amazing–if you know how to do it.
    - Hierarchy in Chinese teams stifles creativity (debunked)
      - Respect for seniority: In our projects, Shenzhen engineers often looked to their senior counterparts for direction. It's not any different in Europe, everyone looks to their seniors. In China, it just felt a bit more pronounced, with an element of actual deference to their opinions.
      - __Action over discussion__: When asked about adding a data quality alert, the Shenzhen team implemented the feature rather than discussing it first. We had to be careful with how we framed questions initially.
        - Clarity in expectations for specific meetings: Framing meetings with clear agendas like "Brainstorming the orchestration sequencing of our ranking model" and preparing Miro boards allowed for open idea sharing.
- Mon, Mar 31, 2025 - 2025a03m31d
  - What annoys us about other people often points to what we dislike about ourselves. Understanding what we dislike about ourselves is just as important for self-awareness as understanding what we like.
  - Ask for Targeted Feedback
    - Think of an aspect of your personality or behavior you'd like to be more self-aware about.
      - Ask people for specific feedback about you and your behavior in that situation. For example: Instead of asking your manager _How am I doing at work?_ try __I'm working on getting better at presenting in group situations. Do you have any feedback for me specifically on how I deliver presentations with our leadership team?__ Note that keeping the feedback domain-specific and behavioral in nature makes it much less threatening for the other person to give you honest feedback.

  - Quote: "The meaning of life is the experience of life," Michael Singer. Core Idea: Life isn't about achieving, fixing, or accumulating; it's about living and experiencing.
    - Accepting life as it is, not trying to control or arrange it, leads to wholeness.

  - __Shane Parrish__ on Procrastination: "Today, not tomorrow. What you avoid today is harder to do tomorrow. Today’s choices become tomorrow’s position. Don't wait till tomorrow; it's where dreams go to die."
    - __Today, Not Tomorrow__: Shane Parrish says, _"Today, not tomorrow. What you avoid today is harder to do tomorrow. Today's choices become tomorrow's position."_
    - __Act today, not tomorrow__. Shane Parrish emphasizes the importance of immediate action to avoid future burdens. Procrastination only adds to the list of tasks.

  - Facts About Human Behavior
    - People Believe What They Already Believe, Even If It’s Wrong
      - Facts don’t change minds; feelings do. People decide first and justify later.
    - The More Choices You Offer, The Less People Decide
      - Too many options can overwhelm people. If you want them to choose, then simplify. Less is more.
    - Always Give Someone a Way Out, Saving Face Defuses Disagreements
      - No one likes being proven wrong. Give them a non-humiliating exit route, allowing them to rethink and change their mind without feeling embarrassed.
    - Criticism Lands Better When Wrapped in Praise
      - A compliment before and after makes feedback feel like advice instead of an attack.
- Sun, Mar 23, 2025 -  2025a03m23d
  - What did someone mean by __“put down roots like a tree”__?
    - __Trees don't rush__. They don't panic when winter comes. They don't waste energy fighting the indifferent weather. They just keep growing their roots, anchoring themselves before they reach higher.
      - When life feels stuck, instead of forcing movement, try going inward:
        - Reflect
        - Learn
        - Calm
        - Be Still
- Sat, Mar 22, 2025 - 2025a03m22d
  - Life isn't about figuring it all out–it's about letting yourself feel it all. That's the experience. That's the gift. That's the meaning.

  - The Hot & Cold Method
    - A file organization system that helps you manage your digital files and folders.
      - Hot Folder: For active projects and things you’re working on right now.
      - Cold Folder: For everything else like reference materials, templates, old projects, and anything you might need later.
    - Hot & Cold Method:
      - Also from Tiago Forte, this method reduces the organization to just two folders:
      - Hot Folder: Contains active projects and immediate work.

  - "Everything changes when you realise diet isn't just what you eat; it's what you watch, read, who you follow, and who you spend time with." Diet applies to everything. Your career, your relationships, your mental health. Give yourself the mental detox you deserve.

  - "Everything changes when you realise diet isn't just what you eat; it's what you watch, read, who you follow, and who you spend time with."
    - Diet is bigger than food.
      - It applies to everything. Your career, your relationships, your mental health. Feed your mind with good stuff. Surround yourself with positive influences. Give yourself the mental detox you deserve.
      - It's what you consume in every sense-what you watch and read, who you follow, and the people you let close. The phrase "you are what you eat" should really be "you are what you consume."

  - Instead of organizing notes by where they should go, start organizing them by how I'd search for them later. Think of it like leaving a note for future-you in a language future-you will actually understand.
    - The best system isn't the most organized one, it's the one that works with your brain instead of against it.

  - "Real integrity is doing the right thing, knowing that nobody's going to know whether you did it or not.”
    - Adapting yourself to circumstances:
      - “We should not try to alter circumstances but to adapt ourselves to them as they really are, just as sailors do. They don't try to change the winds or the sea but ensure that they are always ready to adapt themselves to conditions. In a flat calm they use the oars; with a following breeze they hoist full sail; in a head wind they shorten sail or heave to. Adapt yourself to circumstances in the same way."
