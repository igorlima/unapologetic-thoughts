Adopt the Progress Mindset [^1]

Seneca highlighted the fleeting nature of time. Make progress, even if imperfect, rather than remaining paralyzed by the fear of not doing things perfectly. Every small step matters. Don't wait for the right mood; discipline trumps motivation. Emotions are separate from actions.

This article explores how Stoic philosophy can combat procrastination. The author argues that a Stoic mindset emphasizes the brevity of life, urging immediate action rather than delay. Key Stoic principles discussed include focusing on the present moment, controlling our actions instead of outcomes, embracing progress over perfection, valuing discipline over motivation, and accepting obstacles as opportunities for growth.
