People tolerate unhappiness for a long time if they believe things will get better. They leave when they realize nothing will change, not because they're unhappy. Hopelessness is the real relationship killer. If your partner is pulling away, ask if they've lost hope in the relationship's potential for growth.

When someone hurts you, it's easy to take it personally, but their behavior is about them, not you. People project their inner world onto others. Someone full of self-love and secure will treat you with kindness and respect. If they're full of self-hatred or unhealed trauma, they'll offload that pain onto you.

Love isn't about searching for someone to complete you; it's about becoming the kind of person who can build and sustain a deep, meaningful relationship. Relationships work not because you find the perfect person, but because you become the right person. The healthiest love happens when two complete people come together to grow together, not to fix each other.

If your partner is pulling away, don’t assume they’re just “having a bad day.” Ask yourself: Have they lost hope?

A healthy relationship is not two broken people trying to save each other. It’s two whole people choosing to walk together.
