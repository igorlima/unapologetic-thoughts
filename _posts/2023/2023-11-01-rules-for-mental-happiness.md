“The easiest way to increase happiness is to control your use of time. Can you find more time to do the things you enjoy doing?”

“Money does not buy you happiness, but lack of money certainly buys you misery.”
- What’s the lesson here?
  - Money provides a sense of security and the freedom to pursue your passions and interests. But it won’t guarantee your happiness. __“The greatest wealth is to live content with little,”__ Plato said.
  - What you can do, if you have more of it, is to buy back time for meaningful experiences. It’s how you use it that matters.
  - __“Money is only a tool. It will take you wherever you wish, but it will not replace you as the driver,”__ philosopher Ayn Rand said.

“A happy mood loosens the control of [caution and analysis] over our performance: when in a good mood, people become more intuitive and more creative, but also less vigilant and more prone to logical errors.”

Anchor yourself in the wisdom of Kahneman. __Ask yourself: How can I better control my time? How can I embrace joy while staying vigilant and avoiding errors?__ Answer these questions, and you’ll find yourself on a path to greater mental happiness, one step at a time. [^1]
