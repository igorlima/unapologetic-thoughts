We hold back our ideas when we’re afraid of being rejected. But by remaining
silent we reject ourselves. [^1]

Ideas outside the norm are often considered strange. But what was once strange
sometimes becomes the new normal.

It’s also possible that if people aren’t buying your idea, it’s not good
enough. Or you might need to get better at selling it. [^1]
