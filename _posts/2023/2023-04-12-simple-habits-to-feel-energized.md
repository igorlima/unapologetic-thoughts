When lacking energy and focus, even basic chores take us more time to complete. We’re more irritated and less compassionate when engaging with others. [^1]

a few simple routines that can help to improve how we feel:

## Fix this first

Your energy levels are dictated by the amount and quality of rest you get.

## Fill your days with “energy breaks”

The body is not a machine. It needs breaks.

When feeling tired, we force ourselves to get the work done by grabbing coffee and energy drinks instead of listening to our bodies. But in reality, fighting against our natural energy cycle is the worst thing to do.

__What to do:__ to feel energized and stay focused, we must fill up our cups throughout the day, not just at night. When feeling sluggish or tired, try these two things:
- Allow the body to rest to regain energy (e.g., by taking a power nap).
- Move, so you feel energized through activity (e.g., by going on a walk or doing a quick workout).

## Disconnect to reconnect

We have to keep in mind that social platforms and news sites make money off our attention and that our mental energy and time are our most precious assets.

__Schedule “no phone” time.__

__Go gray.__ The most effective and simple way to spend less time mindlessly using your phone is by turning on grayscale mode.

## So...

Decluttering and resetting your life is a process.

Getting more and better sleep, reducing screen time, getting rid of stuff that drains your energy, and using pauses to fill your own cup can be valuable for different people in different life situations.
