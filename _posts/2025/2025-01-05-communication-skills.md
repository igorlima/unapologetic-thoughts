Nobody knows what you are doing and what you are thinking. Is there anything
that you want? Do you have any issues? Are you stuck? Do you have any
questions? Don’t keep it in. Let it out. Why should you get what you want if
you didn’t ask for it? Communicating your problems, issues, thoughts, results,
and conclusions is vital to success and to being productive in general. [^1]

It’s sometimes embarrassing to ask silly, “dumb,” and naive questions. However,
those who frequently ask “dumb” questions get ahead faster.

The more you practice communicating your needs, thoughts, and ideas, the better
you will become at it—not just in your career but in life in general.

What should you practice?
* Explaining technical stuff
* Storytelling
* Communicating with stakeholders
* Communicating in writing
* Avoiding pitfalls

Where Can You Practice?
* Explain your work to colleagues, friends, or family
* Send frequent status updates
* Volunteer to present
* Join or start a journal club
* Seek feedback
* Create a blog
