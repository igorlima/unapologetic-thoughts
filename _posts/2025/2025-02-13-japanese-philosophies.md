- Haragei
  - Listen beyond words
    - Not everything needs to be said out loud. Sometimes, what's left unsaid matters more.
    - The subtle cues: Body language, tone, intentions, energy, pauses, and even the feeling of a conversation.
    - Haragei teaches us to slow down, observe, and truly listen.
- Shu-Ha-Ri
  - Learn, break, master
    - Growth happens in three stages:
      - Shu (learn): Follow the rules, practice, absorb. Don't question, just learn.
      - Ha (break): Start bending the rules, experiment, adapt, question. Make it your own.
      - Ri (master): Transcend the rules. Movements become instinctual. Work becomes effortless.
- Kakeibo
  - Make mindful spending a habit
    - Kakeibo is Japan's simple, old-school budgeting method. It involves:
      - A notebook, a pen, and four questions:
        - How much money do I have?
        - How much do I want to save?
        - How much am I spending?
        - How can I improve?
- Hanko
  - Make your mark on life
- Shikata ga nai
  - Let go of what you can't control
    - Some things won't change no matter how much we wish they would.
    - It's about accepting what you can't change.
    - Focus on what you can influence. Letting go reduces anxiety. Practice it by accepting delays, setbacks, and personal loss with quiet strength.
- Gaman
  - Transcend the seemingly unbearable with strength and dignity
    - You don't choose what happens, but you choose your response.
    - Suffering is inevitable, but complaining doesn't help. Strength comes from pushing through with quiet resilience.
- Enso
  - Reflect on simplicity
- Chisoku
  - Know when enough is enough.
    - Happiness isn't in the next big thing or outcome. Chisoku means knowing you have enough.
    - Contentment is the way forward. Appreciate what you have now.
    - Gratitude increases happiness.
- Nagomi
  - Find inner harmony in all things
    - Nagomi is balance, peace, and acceptance, not perfection or control.
    - Life pulls us in many directions. Nagomi reminds us to slow down, blend with life, and not fight it.
    - Inner peace comes from not resisting reality.
