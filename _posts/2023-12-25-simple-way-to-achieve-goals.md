__Strategy__ [^1]

_I love reading corporate strategy because I’m a big fan of fiction. Typically, it’s a phrasebook of jargon that could make a dictionary weep. It says nothing, offends no one, has no clear actions, and makes no hard decisions._

Ready to be strategic? Let’s get to it…

Strategy is about what you do but it’s even more about what you don’t do.

Too many priorities = no priorities.

And tough choices often mean irritating people. A good strategy is not about making everyone happy. That’s the job of a clown at a children’s party, not a strategist.

In personal strategy, it means devoting less time, energy and money to one area of your life and more to another. Everyone is not going to be happy and that’s why we don’t make tough choices and that’s often why strategies fail.

__So make a list. Consider what's important to you.__
