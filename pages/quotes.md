> "Most of the amazing things in life make up over time. **Patience is a superpower**."
  - Morgan Housel's quote
  - <details><summary><sup><sub>...</sub></sup></summary>
      <ul>
        <li> Morgan Housel's quote, "Most of the amazing things in life make up over time. Patience is a superpower," emphasizes the importance of long-term thinking and delayed gratification in achieving success and fulfillment. He suggests that great things, whether in love, careers, or investments, gain their value from both patience in allowing growth and scarcity in appreciating the final result.  </li>
        <li>
          This quote highlights several key ideas: 
          <ul>
            <li>Compounding: Many aspects of life, like financial investments, relationships, and career growth, benefit from the principle of compounding, where small gains accumulate over time to create significant results. </li>
            <li>Long-term perspective: Housel encourages readers to adopt a long-term perspective, recognizing that true success often requires sustained effort and patience. </li>
            <li>The power of patience: The quote explicitly states that patience is a superpower, suggesting it is a valuable and often underestimated trait that can lead to remarkable achievements. </li>
            <li> Avoiding instant gratification: Housel implies that the allure of quick fixes and instant results can be detrimental to achieving lasting success. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          In essence, the quote encourages individuals to cultivate patience and embrace the process of growth, recognizing that the most rewarding things in life often take time to develop and mature

> "Life is strange. We arrive with nothing and struggle for everything, and in the end, we leave with nothing and go on our way."
  - <details><summary><sup><sub>The core idea is most famously attributed to...</sub></sup></summary>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Buddhist Teachings:</strong> The concept of impermanence (anicca) and the detachment from material possessions is central to Buddhism. Many Buddhist teachings emphasize that we arrive with nothing and leave with nothing, and that attachment to worldly things leads to suffering. A common paraphrase often attributed to Buddha is: "We are born with nothing, we die with nothing, and in between, we fight for everything."
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The Book of Ecclesiastes (Bible):</strong> This book, known for its philosophical reflections on the meaning of life, contains a very similar verse:
          <br><i><strong>Ecclesiastes 5:15 (NIV):</strong> "Naked a person comes from his mother’s womb, and as he comes, so he departs. He takes nothing from his toil that he can carry in his hand."</i>

      </ol>

        <ul>
          <li>A vida é estranha. Chegamos sem nada e lutamos por tudo, e no final, deixamos tudo e partimos sem nada.</li>
