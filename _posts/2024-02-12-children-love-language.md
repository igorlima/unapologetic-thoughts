- acts of service
- and quality time

A kid who basks in praise might become skeptical of your reassurance at some point and instead, just need a little quality time. Stay tuned in to what your child's reactions and behaviors say about the type of love they need in any given moment and there's no doubt that you'll continue to connect—and reconnect—as they grow. https://www.parents.com/parenting/better-parenting/advice/love-languages-of-children/ 09/02/2024, 14:14 Página 12 de 12._
