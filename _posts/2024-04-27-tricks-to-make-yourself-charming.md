__From the first moment you walk into a room people are making judgements about how much they like you. Fortunately, there are ways to improve your chances.__ [^1]

- __Channel Your Charm__
  - Olivia Fox Cabane, an executive coach and author of The Charisma Myth, defines charm as likability and “how delightful it is to interact with someone.”
- __Raising Eyebrows__
  - “Our brains are always surveying the environment for friend or foe signals.” “The three major things we do when we approach somebody that signal we are not a threat are: an eyebrow flash - a quick up and down movement of the eyebrow that lasts about a sixthof a second - a slight head tilt, and a smile.”
  - “The golden rule of friendship is if you make people feel good about themselves, they’re going to like you.”
- __Find Common Ground__
  - “When you disagree, try to really listen to the other person rather than setting up your response, which research shows smart people tend to do.” “It might seem like you totally disagree but on closer examination you might agree on a few things, at least in principle.”
- __Watch Their Body__
  - “So you can use that and mirror them so you can signal to them that you have good rapport.”

> "Research has found that the quicker I can get someone to answer personal questions, the quicker that relationship is going to advance."
  - “So if I’m selling something, the more quickly I develop rapport and get you to say all sorts of intimate details about your life, the faster you will treat me as a friend and the faster I can get to my sell.”
