Only have a couple of minutes? Thatâ€™s enough time for a joy break! [^1]

Joy breaks are activities you can do in five minutes or less that make you happy, like gathering flowers from your yard or taking a quick cuddle break with your pet. 

And to help make joy breaks a part of your routine, try incorporating them into various parts of your day, like when you cross something off your to-do list or feel your focus drifting.
