Ever had one of those nights where your brain finally figures out how to fix a bug—just as you're trying to sleep? We’ve all been there! Here are some tips to manage those late-night coding epiphanies without losing sleep:

1. Keep a Notebook by Your Bed
  - Jot down the idea before you forget it. Sometimes, writing it down helps you clear your mind and sleep better. 📝
2. Embrace a Debugging Routine
  - Set a specific time during the day for deep problem-solving so your brain doesn’t surprise you at night. ⏰
3. Take Regular Breaks
  - A well-rested brain solves bugs faster than an overworked one! Remember, it’s okay to step away. 🛑
4. Use Task Tracking Tools
  - Tools like Jira, Trello, or Notion help you note down bugs and fixes so you can tackle them at the right time. ✅
5. Practice Relaxation Before Bed
  - Meditation, reading, or light music can help shift your brain away from coding mode. 🧘

Your brain is a powerhouse, but even CPUs need rest! Recharge, and let those bright ideas flow at the right time. 💡💤
