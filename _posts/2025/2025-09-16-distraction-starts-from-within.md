title: Distraction Starts from Within
category: inspiration

Internal triggers - like boredom, anxiety, stress, or frustration - often drive us to escape into things that feel good in the moment but take us off track. [^1]

Decode your personal distraction patterns and replacing them with traction: actions that move you closer to what matters.

You don’t need superhuman willpower. You need the tools to listen to yourself more clearly, and respond with intention.

- Step One:
  - Most distractions are emotional responses in disguise. The next time you get the urge to check your phone, switch tasks, or escape from what you’re doing - pause and reflect.
  - You can’t fix what you don’t notice.
- Step Two:
  - The 10-second delay
    - A 10-second pause can change everything. It’s a tiny wedge that helps you make a conscious choice.
  - Urges are like waves. If you ride them, rather than act on them, they often pass.
- Step Three:
  - Remember: your goal isn’t to suppress the urge, it’s to channel it.
  - You can’t call something a distraction unless you know what it’s distracting you from.
- Step Four:
  - Internal triggers aren’t flaws. They’re signals. Instead of avoiding them, get curious. This reflection practice helps you respond with compassion and clarity.
  - Time management is pain management.

__FROM DISTRACTION TO TRACTION__
- Awareness precedes control. You can’t change what you don’t notice. Keep spotting your triggers.
- Urges are temporary. You don’t have to resist or give in—you can ride the wave.
- You don’t need more willpower—you need better systems. Create a space where traction is the default.

> You control what comes next.
> That’s how you become indistractable."**_ [^2]
