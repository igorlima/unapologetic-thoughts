Why pulling instead of pushing is so important? [^1]

Here’s the thing, for people to feel fully accepted for who they are, they must first feel seen for who they are. When you __“push”__ your stories, your experiences, and your feelings into that space, you are guaranteeing that they will not feel seen or heard.

On the other hand, when you __“pull”__ their feelings, opinions, and experiences into the space, you are ultimately making that person feel heard and valued for their unique and authentic self. If you then respond without judgment and by validating them, you will have created a feeling of intimacy. The formula is simple:

- Container + Vulnerability + Validation = Intimacy

__People who list their achievements are really saying, “I need you to validate me.”__

Signs of Pushing
- highlighting accomplishments
- repeating pre-rehearsed stories
- dominating the conversation
- sharing other peoples’ opinions of you
- stating your expectations, desires, and needs a lot
- providing unsolicited solutions

How to Pull to Create Intimacy
- listening for threads
- validating emotions
- asking feeling based follow up questions
- holding a mirror
- giving genuine praise versus casual flattery


## Takeaway

__“How do I want this person to feel after spending time with me?”_

> “I’ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.” — Maya Angelou

when someone (red) employs the pushing method, the space between the two people is filled only with you. There is no room for the other person. Graphic created by author.
