There’s something irresistible and even mysterious when we do things differently to most. [^1]

- Don’t interrupt.
  - Such a simple thing. But it’s not easy to do.
  - Many don’t even realise it when they do it, but they interrupt, not to be intentionally rude, but often out of insecurity.
  - When we interrupt, we inadvertently signal our sense of inadequacy.
  - We want to be seen. So we undermine the attention others are getting to steal back some for ourselves.
  - This is low-status activity and will lose you respect.
  - __Give people space.__ This is what leaders do.
  - They are in no rush and are totally happy for others to be in the limelight.
- Being vulnerable is respected when it serves a positive purpose.
  - When I am willing to look ‘inferior’ to demonstrate a point that ultimately helps others, that’s strength.
  - For example, you can tell me that you still get anxious before interviews, but you tell me so that I feel encouraged.
  - You are showing me your humanity while lifting me.
- Be an occasional dick.
  - You don’t always need to be nice to people if it’s done playfully.
  - Go against the grain, be a little naughty, and you will have people falling in love with you.
- Be there.
  - The next time you watch people interact, note how present people are in the conversation.
  - A lot of the time, you will find people are anywhere but in the interaction. People are lost in their heads.

__*This will attract people to you, and often they won’t even know why.*__ [^1]
