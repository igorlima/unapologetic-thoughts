The four kinds of behavior types [^1] [^2] [^3] - the simple four color system allows you to speedily identify a friend or coworker and adjust how you speak and share with them:
- __Reds__ who are dominant and commanding,
- __Yellows__ who are social and optimistic,
- __Greens__ who are laid back and friendly,
- and __Blues__ who are analytical and precise.

Whenever you say something, your message will be filtered through the listener's experiences, biases and attitudes.
- __red__ people are impatient and focused on results,
- __yellow__ people are positive and need to be the center of attention,
- __green__ people, which are the most common, are calm and good listeners,
- and __blue__ people are well organized and pay attention to detail.

These four types help to picture them in a two-by-two square, with the top two, from left to right, being __Blue__ and __Red__, and with __Gree__ positioned below Blue, and __Yellow__ below Red.

| - | - |
| :---: | :---: |
| Blue | Red |
| Green | Yellow |

Now, each side of this square shows how these different personality types share same common traits.
- __*At the top*__, both __Blue__ and __Red__ tend to place importance on tasks and issues.
- __*On the bottom*__, __Green__ and __Yellow__ tend to focus on people and relationships.
- Likewise, __*on left*__ you have __Blue__ and __Green__, who tend to be reserved and introverted.
- __*On the right*__ you have __Red__ and __Yellow__, who tend to be extroverted and proactive.
