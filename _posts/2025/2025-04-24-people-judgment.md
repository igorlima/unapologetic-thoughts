- Reflection of Others: I learned a long time ago that whatever others say or do is a reflection of their fear, anger, pride, guilt, shame, or ignorance.
  - Karma: It's their karma, not yours.

**You don't need everyone to get you to feel worthy.** [^1]

_“Don’t take anything personally. Nothing others do is because of you. It is because of themselves."_

- Live from the inside out, not the outside in.
  - People are going to judge. Always. You can’t stop it. You can’t control how they see you. But you can control how much of it you take on.
- Everyone sees the world through their own lens.
  - Their behavior is their responsibility. Your response is your freedom.
