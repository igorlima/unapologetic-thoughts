Whenever some event impacts our lives, we generally attribute some type of value to that event. We label it a “success” or a “failure” or something in- between. [^1]

However, what we often don’t pay as much attention to is how we respond to the little things — but it’s actually the little moments that matter, at least in terms of how our colleagues perceive us. It’s these little daily interactions that we have with our peers and coworkers that really determine how they remember and perceive us.

How do you close the loop when someone is waiting for your response?

When you show up to meetings, are you bringing your whole self, or are you just making an appearance. Trust me, I know that too many meetings on your calendar is a pain, and once in a while we get dragged into a meeting that definitely could have been an email, but it’s important to be present especially when your colleagues are sharing insights and results.

People admire colleagues who work hard but who also aren’t constantly on the verge of burnout.

Your coworkers are human, and while it is important to have good boundaries and respect the privacy of your coworkers, there is nothing to be gained by being rigid — and it will pay dividends if you take the time to remember days that help your employees feel special.
