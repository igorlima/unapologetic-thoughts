So who is going to teach us about productivity? Monks. [^1]

A few question to find motivation. Take a second to think about why what you’re doing is important or meaningful. Who is helped? Whose life will be better because of the work you’re doing?

Occasionally take some needed time alone and it might be a good thing.

__Mindfulness tells us not to judge our thoughts, to distance ourselves from them.__

Label thoughts: _"That’s not me; that’s the demon talking."_ Give your own metaphorical mental demon a name. Call it out when it tries to lead you astray. Might sound nuts but we’ve got a few hundred years of proof – and plenty of neuroscience – to show this can help.

__Mindfulness:__ The thoughts multiply like Gremlins. So treat them like Gremlins. They’re not you. Notice them, label them, and tell them, _“I see you, Mara.”_ They’ll vanish back to the spirit world and you can focus.

__It’s not where you live; it’s how you live.__
