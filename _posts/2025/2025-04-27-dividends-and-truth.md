title: Dividends and Truth

There are two types of truth:
- Political truth
  - True because many other people think they are.
  - True because many people believe it to be true, often influenced by social consensus.
    - <sup><sub>Political truths are true because many people believe them (e.g., who the president is, a country's border). This is a psychological phenomenon; changing widespread belief changes the "truth."</sub></sup>
- Technical truth
  - True for physical or technical reasons.
  - True for physical or technical reasons, independent of human opinion.
    - <sup><sub>Technical truths are based on physical or technical reasons (e.g., an equation's result, a virus's diameter). What people think doesn't change them.</sub></sup>

- Stock Market and Dividends
  - Stock Market Prices as Political Truths:
  - Stock market prices and valuations are often based on political truths.
  - Stock market prices and valuations are given as examples of political truths, which can be subject to market hype and fluctuate significantly.
    - In contrast, dividends are presented as technical truths because they are based on actual cash payments from a company's profits. The payment of dividends is not influenced by external opinions or market hype but is determined by the company's financial performance.
- Dividends as Technical Truths
  - Dividends are either paid or not paid with no ambiguity.
  - Dividend payments come from the company's cash flows and are not influenced by stock market perceptions or investor sentiment.
