Different types of note-takers [^1]

Project management is different from note taking which is different from task management.

There are many types of note-takers based on their organizing pattern, their workflow, and even their skills in some cases.

- The Librarians
  - This type of note-takers wants their notes to be as similar as possible to... well... a library. They barely use the “search” feature. They believe in a highly organized note-taking experience where they could easily say where their pages are, through an intricate tag system, notebook hierarchy, and so on, allowing you to mark anything, and write anything on the page, from todo to images and so on.
- The Architects
  - These are the note-takers who don’t want their notes to be 100% perfect. They usually prefer a hierarchy system that could embed or be embedded as many times as we like... Also, this type relies heavily on search tools, and don’t mind having the notes messy. They believe in putting all the mess into the notes and searching whenever they need something so that their minds could stay clear. Also, when I say “mess” I mean a lot of stuff that would be untouched for a long time. I don’t mean literal useless notes.
- The Gardeners
  - This is a type of note-takers who completely depends on the hierarchy and tree system of the note-taking apps themselves. Every element and info is gonna be collapsed into some data and would be added to the tree. They are very similar to the Architects, but they prefer having a limit/boundary to keep the notes more organized and easily searchable through the tree. They are also way less robust compared to Architects.
- The Students
  - If you are of this type, you could be something else along with any of the above or just this type. Students just want something to have notes on with at most minimal distractions, and easy-to-go around workflow.
