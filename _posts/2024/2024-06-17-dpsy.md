What makes DSPy unique? How is DSPy different from LangChain or LlamaIndex? [^1]
- DSPy is a framework developed by Stanford University that can automatically
  optimize LLM prompts and weights.
  - DSPy is conceptually similar to PyTorch. You define modules in your
    program, treat the prompts you use as weights for the model, and train the
    optimal prompts on the training data. In DSPy, this training step is called
    "Compile".
- LangChain, LlamaIndex, and DSPy are frameworks that help developers easily
  build applications based on LMs (Language Models)
  - The typical LangChain and LlamaIndex pipeline usually involves prompt
    templates, making the entire pipeline sensitive to component changes.

In contrast, DSPy shifts the construction of LM-based pipelines from operating
prompts to being closer to programming.

In short, the advantage of using DSPy is that you donâ€™t have to write the
prompts yourself, it will automatically adjust the prompts behind the scenes if
the data is available
