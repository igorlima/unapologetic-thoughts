You don’t suffer because of your past. You suffer because of how you cope with the past. [^1]

Your memories and emotions are a part of you—even the painful ones. So the more you treat them like problems, the more like a problem you will feel.

The only way out of this suffering is through acceptance: When you commit to treating all the parts of yourself—including painful memories of your past—with kindness and compassion, only then will you find peace. Emotional validation is a good place to start.
