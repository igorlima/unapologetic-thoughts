It’s important to learn through both experimentation and research (objective learning). But it’s equally important to go within ourselves (subjective learning).

Subjective and objective learning need to work together. [^1]

There’s no objective learning without subjectivity anyway, because objective reality has to be interpreted subjectively. Objective reality is beyond the material world, because there is no material world, only the experience of one.

Subjective and objective aren’t separate. To borrow a term from Thich Nhat Hanh, they “inter-are”.
