- Have you recently made a mistake you’re ashamed of? What did you learn from it?
- If you could have a conversation with the younger version of yourself, what would you say?
- Are you proud of yourself? Why or why not? If you aren’t, what changes can you make so that a year from now you can look back with pride?
