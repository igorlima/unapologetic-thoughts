To create meaningful connections, shift the focus from yourself to the other person. People inherently seek connection and positive affirmation, so give them your attention, and ask intriguing questions to engage them. Here are five excellent conversation starters:

1. What's your story? This open-ended inquiry invites the person to share their life experiences, dreams, and goals from the heart.
2. What makes you smile when you get up in the morning? Begin the interaction on a positive note, encouraging the person to reflect on their sources of excitement and gratitude.
3. What is that one book that has influenced you the most? This question opens the door to follow-up inquiries about the impact of the book on various aspects of their life. If books aren't their thing, ask about movies or influential figures.
4. What absolutely excites you right now? This inquiry sparks passion and can lead to discussions about career, personal life, or any thrilling new phase.
5. What's the most important thing I should know about you? This question, like the others, elicits emotions and helps create a deeper connection, allowing you to understand what makes the person unique or what challenges they face.

Notice the pattern? These questions make the conversation about the other person, allowing them to talk about themselves. By doing so, you become the most interesting person in the room through this act of selflessness.
