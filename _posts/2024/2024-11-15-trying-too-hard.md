Sometimes it's not working because you're trying too hard. You're trying to force something that can't be forced. Take a step back. [^1]

This is especially true in human relations. Focus more on helping the other person get what they want, instead of trying to make them give you what you want.

_It suggests that forcing outcomes or trying to control others often backfires. Instead, the author encourages a shift in focus towards helping the other persion achieve their goals. This more collaborative approach is presented as a more effective way to build positive interactions and achieve desired outcomes._
