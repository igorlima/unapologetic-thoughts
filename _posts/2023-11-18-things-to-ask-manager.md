title: Things to Ask Your Manager at your Next Check-In
category: speaking
---

Get more guidance, clarity, and feedback from your manager during your one-on-one meetings.

For each 1:1 meeting, pick a category or two to focus on. You can’t address them all in every meeting.

No need to ask them all at one time.

- __Ask for guidance on tasks and projects__:
  - _I’m having some challenges with X. Can you help me think about how to navigate it successfully?_
- __Clarify priorities and expectations__:
  - _Given what’s on my plate, what should I be prioritizing right now, and can you help me understand why?_
- __Align with the organization and its strategy__:
  - _To help me better understand the big picture, how does the work I’m doing fit into the company’s broader goals?_
- __Seek growth opportunities and career advancement__
  - _How can we make sure that my skillset is put to the best use to support the team and the organization?_
- __Get feedback on your performance__
  - _What feedback might you be able to share with me about how I’m doing at X or Y task?_
- __Build a relationship__
  - _How is your day going? How are things going for you overall?_
  - _What is something you are excited about outside of work?_
- __Offer support__
  - _What are your priorities over the next X days? What can I do to help you with this?_
  - _What keeps you up at night that I can help with?_
