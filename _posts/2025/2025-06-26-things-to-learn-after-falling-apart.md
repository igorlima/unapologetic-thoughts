Things to help us notice about ourselves, our patterns, and our thoughts. [^1]

- Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.
  - If you don't face your old habits and past experiences, they will control your life, and you won't even have a choice.
  - You'll think life is just "bad luck" or "fate," but really, it's your past running the show.
- Everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves.
  - People annoy us because they remind us of things in ourselves that we don't want to see.
  - We all have parts of ourselves that we don't want to look at, and when we see those same things in someone else, we might be annoyed. This is called projection.
- Shoe that fits one person pinches another; there is no recipe for living that suits all cases.
  - Do not use someone else's standards to measure your life.
  - What works for one person might not work for someone else.
  - There's no one-size-fits-all.
- The greatest and most important problems of life are all fundamentally insoluble. They can never be solved but only outgrown.
  - Some things won't be repaired; they can only be overcome.
  - We don't defeat them; we just become a person they can no longer touch. We don't "figure things out"; we become someone who doesn't have to. This process is called Reframing.
- Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakens.
  - Most people try to fix their problems by changing everything around them, rather than looking within themselves.
  - Instead of asking "Why does this always happen to me?", we should ask "What am I doing that is leading me here?"
