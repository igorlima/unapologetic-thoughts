So much of what bothers us now, one day won’t matter. The ability to let things go now and live in the moment can save us years of stress.

Holding onto them does not keep bad things from happening. And sometimes holding onto them causes us to take actions which make things worse than if we had just let them go.

Learn to let go, not so you can do less, but so you can be more. [^1]

We are not fully ourselves if we do not know how to let go.

Don’t put yourself on a treadmill, learn to sit quietly.

Deal with what is now, let later be later.
