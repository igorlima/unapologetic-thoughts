Method for reducing judgment of people and appreciating them just as they are.

**Practice “turning people into trees.”** [^1]

See their struggles as roots reaching for stability. See their quirks as
branches bending toward their light. Appreciate them as they are. And do the
same for yourself.

In the woods, you don’t judge trees. You see them for what they are. A bent
tree makes you curious, not critical. You notice how it grew toward the light.
You don’t think it’s wrong for being crooked. Trees don’t try to be anything
other than what they are. They grow where they can. They stretch toward the
sun. They bend around obstacles. And somehow, they are always enough. You
accept it.

But with people, we don’t do that. I don’t. You don’t. We judge. We compare. We
label people as too much or not enough. We do the same to ourselves. We think
they’re too loud, too selfish, too weird. Or worse, I’m too much, not enough,
and everything is wrong. That judging mind takes over.

**In the woods, none of that exists.**

Observing without judgment changes everything. It opens the door to acceptance.

The perspective of viewing people's flaws and struggles with the same
acceptance and curiosity one has for the imperfections of nature—significantly
reduced their own judgment.

**By practicing this non-judgmental observation, both of others and oneself,
one can cultivate acceptance, compassion, and more meaningful connections,
finding peace in the inherent imperfections of life.**
