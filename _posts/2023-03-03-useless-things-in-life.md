A cluttered to-do list leads to decision fatigue, which gets you stressed [^1].

"Analysis paralysis" is a thing. When you’re faced with too many choices or a list of things to do, you’re more likely to feel overwhelmed.

The point is to be intentional about everything, and do a thing if the desire is to save time. _"What's the top 3-4 important things that make the most significant impact on my life and carrer?"._

_Do you ever feel like you’re just trying to survive the day before you’ve even started?_ This happens when you’re in reaction mode. You probably didn’t plan your day the previous night. Your mornings are so important.

Remember, it’s not about WHEN you wake up but rather about WHAT you do when you wake up.

When waking up not knowing what to do in the day ahead, it's more likely to procrastinate or stay in bed too long or browse the phone. 

The plan is to plan the day the previous night. It takes a few minutes. And it makes a huge impact on how focused the person is in the morning.
