  - What annoys us about other people often points to what we dislike about ourselves. Understanding what we dislike about ourselves is just as important for self-awareness as understanding what we like.
  - Ask for Targeted Feedback
    - Think of an aspect of your personality or behavior you'd like to be more self-aware about.
      - Ask people for specific feedback about you and your behavior in that situation. For example: Instead of asking your manager _How am I doing at work?_ try __I'm working on getting better at presenting in group situations. Do you have any feedback for me specifically on how I deliver presentations with our leadership team?__ Note that keeping the feedback domain-specific and behavioral in nature makes it much less threatening for the other person to give you honest feedback.

  - Quote: "The meaning of life is the experience of life," Michael Singer. Core Idea: Life isn't about achieving, fixing, or accumulating; it's about living and experiencing.
    - Accepting life as it is, not trying to control or arrange it, leads to wholeness.

  - __Shane Parrish__ on Procrastination: "Today, not tomorrow. What you avoid today is harder to do tomorrow. Today’s choices become tomorrow’s position. Don't wait till tomorrow; it's where dreams go to die."
    - __Today, Not Tomorrow__: Shane Parrish says, _"Today, not tomorrow. What you avoid today is harder to do tomorrow. Today's choices become tomorrow's position."_
    - __Act today, not tomorrow__. Shane Parrish emphasizes the importance of immediate action to avoid future burdens. Procrastination only adds to the list of tasks.

  - Facts About Human Behavior
    - People Believe What They Already Believe, Even If It’s Wrong
      - Facts don’t change minds; feelings do. People decide first and justify later.
    - The More Choices You Offer, The Less People Decide
      - Too many options can overwhelm people. If you want them to choose, then simplify. Less is more.
    - Always Give Someone a Way Out, Saving Face Defuses Disagreements
      - No one likes being proven wrong. Give them a non-humiliating exit route, allowing them to rethink and change their mind without feeling embarrassed.
    - Criticism Lands Better When Wrapped in Praise
      - A compliment before and after makes feedback feel like advice instead of an attack.
- Sun, Mar 23, 2025 -  2025a03m23d
  - What did someone mean by __“put down roots like a tree”__?
    - __Trees don't rush__. They don't panic when winter comes. They don't waste energy fighting the indifferent weather. They just keep growing their roots, anchoring themselves before they reach higher.
      - When life feels stuck, instead of forcing movement, try going inward:
        - Reflect
        - Learn
        - Calm
        - Be Still
- Sat, Mar 22, 2025 - 2025a03m22d
  - Life isn't about figuring it all out–it's about letting yourself feel it all. That's the experience. That's the gift. That's the meaning.

  - The Hot & Cold Method
    - A file organization system that helps you manage your digital files and folders.
      - Hot Folder: For active projects and things you’re working on right now.
      - Cold Folder: For everything else like reference materials, templates, old projects, and anything you might need later.
    - Hot & Cold Method:
      - Also from Tiago Forte, this method reduces the organization to just two folders:
      - Hot Folder: Contains active projects and immediate work.
      - Cold Folder: Houses everything else, including past projects, reference materials, etc.
      - The method promotes focus by limiting visible files to current tasks and uses tags and subfolders within the Cold Folder to keep everything searchable.
    - The benefits of the Hot & Cold Method:
      - Focus: Reduces distractions by showing only relevant files.
      - Time Efficiency: Eliminates the need for extensive sorting.
      - Scalability: Allows for future refinement of the system.

  - Naming Stressors:
    - Work Stress: Taught me I needed better boundaries.
    - Financial Stress: Taught me I needed a better budget.
    - Relationship Stress: Taught me I needed to communicate better.
  - Naming your stressors is powerful. It takes away their power, turning them from monsters into teachers. Stress shows you where you need to change. Don't fight them; don't ignore them. Face them, learn from them.
    - Pain shows you where you need to grow and heal.

  - The Magic of Starting Small
    - __1-minute micro habits__ are so easy to do that they automatically eliminate our stupid excuses like “I don’t have time” or “It’s too hard.”
    - It doesn't have to push yourself, and it seemed so easy to your brain that you couldn’t find an excuse to skip it.
      - "It felt effortless because I wasn’t forcing the changes — they happened organically."
      - "One of the biggest lessons I’ve learned is that consistency matters more than intensity."

  - bizarre psychology fact that may change how we see people
    - people will judge us based on their mood, not logic
  - our brains are forgetting machines
    - this is a concept from Quiroga's book "The Forgetting Machine"
    - there explains why remembering everything woulb be energetically and computationally impossible/expensive for our brains
    - why we can't remember everything we study? __because__ we don't link informtion from __short-term__ to __long-term__ memory <a href="#2000a10m01d-20001001212101">§</a> <a id="2025a02m27d-20250301045437"></a>

  - A stupidly simple fix for procrastination
    - Little trick:
      1. If something takes less than 2 minutes, just do it.
      2. If it’s longer, just start for 2 minutes.
    - That’s it. No commitment beyond that.
      - The __2-Minute Rule__
        - To overcome procrastination, start tasks with just a two-minute commitment. This small step can lead to continued action as the task becomes less daunting.

  - How to get teens to do what you want?
    - Motivation Techniques:

  - You teach people how to treat you.
    - People learn how to treat you based on what you allow. If you always say yes when you want to say no, they'll expect that from you. If you laugh off disrespect, they'll assume it's fine.
    - Boundaries are not walls; they're guidelines. They show people how to engage with you respectfully.
    - You take back your power when you teach others how to treat you.
    - You teach people how to treat you by how you treat yourself.
    - Boundaries: Teach others how to treat you by setting and maintaining your boundaries.

  - "Everything changes when you realise diet isn't just what you eat; it's what you watch, read, who you follow, and who you spend time with." Diet applies to everything. Your career, your relationships, your mental health. Give yourself the mental detox you deserve.
    - __Broader Definition of Diet__: The concept of diet is extended beyond food to include what we consume mentally and socially, advocating for a mental detox.

  - "Everything changes when you realise diet isn't just what you eat; it's what you watch, read, who you follow, and who you spend time with."
    - Diet is bigger than food.
      - It applies to everything. Your career, your relationships, your mental health. Feed your mind with good stuff. Surround yourself with positive influences. Give yourself the mental detox you deserve.
      - It's what you consume in every sense-what you watch and read, who you follow, and the people you let close. The phrase "you are what you eat" should really be "you are what you consume."
- Thu, Jan 23, 2025 - 2025a01m23d
  - Instead of organizing notes by where they should go, start organizing them by how I'd search for them later. Think of it like leaving a note for future-you in a language future-you will actually understand.
    - The best system isn't the most organized one, it's the one that works with your brain instead of against it.
- Sun, Jan 19, 2025 - 2025a01m19d
  - "Real integrity is doing the right thing, knowing that nobody's going to know whether you did it or not.”
    - Adapting yourself to circumstances:
      - “We should not try to alter circumstances but to adapt ourselves to them as they really are, just as sailors do. They don't try to change the winds or the sea but ensure that they are always ready to adapt themselves to conditions. In a flat calm they use the oars; with a following breeze they hoist full sail; in a head wind they shorten sail or heave to. Adapt yourself to circumstances in the same way."

  - When rewarding the candor, it is more likely to get more of it.
  - Did you like what the colleague have done? Thanks them in public. Let them know. Both gain in this win-win game. It shows gratitude. Also, and a thankful word is a fuel to keep a good habit last.
