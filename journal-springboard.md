title: Springboard & Central Hub for journal, thoughts and ideas
---

A springboard to launch from and explore other sources and then diving into more detailed research.

<details markdown="block"><summary><sup><i>more about this page...</i></sup></summary>
This is a centralized page to gather thoughts and ideas, draft, sketch, and jot down journal entries. It's a place to link and connect dots from various sources. The initial goal is to keep this page concise, making it a starting point from where I can branch out and explore various other resources.
- A place to start with brainstorm, doodle out ideas, and keep a written journal.
- A giant spiderweb where I can connect stuff from all over the places.
- A launching pad for exploring deeper in other sources.

## Journaling

Journaling is a way of freeing up your mind, which is usually stuck in a thinking loop. By journaling, you will limit the amount of data that seems to be significant at the momment by saying the essential bit on a paper.

_Journaling means you are going to write a message to your future self. You may decide to read it or not. But it will be there for you to inspect._

__Ask yourself questions. Answer them. Or leave them open.__
