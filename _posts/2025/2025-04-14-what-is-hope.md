Hope is not simply optimism. Optimism is believing the future will be better; hope is believing the future will be better and that you have a role in making it so . Hope involves pragmatic action, unlike wishful thinking or "manifesting," which research shows can be detrimental to achieving goals. One study showed that students with realistic expectations and plans achieved far more than those who focused on positive fantasies.

To inspire hope in others, communicate a positive future, emphasize everyone's role, and highlight the commitment required. Most importantly, generate genuine excitement about the future.

Hope is not passive; it demands action. [^1]
