Bizarre Truths [^1]

1. **People who look good get treated better.** It doesn’t matter how much we say we care about personality, someone with a pretty face is going to have things easier. Job, dating, friends, all of it.
2. **Motivation doesn’t come first, action does.** Waiting to “feel ready” is just wasting time. You start doing it first, then motivation comes later.
  - What does that mean? It means the hardest part is just starting. Even if it’s small.
3. **Most people don’t want advice, they want someone to agree.** They tell problems not for fixing, just for someone to say "Yeah, that sucks." Try to give a solution, they won’t listen.
  - Instead of giving advice, just agree.
  - They don’t want a solution, they want a co-sign. If they actually want advice, they’ll ask. If people really wanted solutions, self-help books would actually help people.
4. **People kinda enjoy it when others fail.** Nobody says it, but it’s true. When someone who seems perfect messes up, people watch like it’s the best show on TV.
  - Deep down, nothing is more entertaining than watching someone crash and burn—especially if they seemed a little too successful, a little too happy.
  - It’s not that people wish failure on others. It’s just... oddly satisfying when those who seemed untouchable prove they’re not.
5. **You are only important as long as you are useful.** Friends, work, and even...
  - To most people, you are what you do for them. You’re the “fun one,” the “useful one,” the “connected one.” When that role disappears, so does their reason to keep you around.
  - The fact is, people value you for what you provide. You’re only as important as your usefulness.
  - This is why networking is more important than hard work. It’s why some of the least talented people are wildly successful–they know how to be useful to the right people.
  - Pay attention to who’s still around when you have nothing to offer.
6. **People don’t care about you, they care how they feel when they are with you.** If you make them feel smart or funny, they like you. But if you stop doing that, they forget you fast.
  - This is why people who suddenly lose wealth, status, or influence always seem so shocked at how fast their social circle shrinks. You weren’t liked. You were useful.
7. **You Don’t Have Free Will - You Just Have A Collection Of Habits And Social Conditioning.** You just do what you learned from childhood and habit. If you wanna change, you gotta break out of old patterns.
    - Almost everything you do is the result of:
        - Habits you formed years ago
        - The culture you grew up in
        - Social norms telling you what’s “acceptable”
    - From the way you dress to the food you crave to the way you handle conflict, it’s all programmed. You’re just following a script you didn’t write.
    - Your brain is running on autopilot most of the time. You’re not really deciding things. You’re following patterns. So, does free will actually exist or not?
