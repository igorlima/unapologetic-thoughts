**Caption:**

This image showcases the different ways to use the `markitdown` Python library, along with its Docker integration. The code snippets illustrate two primary use cases for `markitdown`: converting files into Markdown format and leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for image descriptions.

The first section, titled "Python API," demonstrates the basic usage:

* **Basic Conversion:** A snippet imports `MarkItDown`, initializes an instance, converts "test.xlsx" to Markdown, and prints the text content. This shows how simple it is to convert local files to a textual format.
* **LLM Integration:** The next snippet shows how to integrate an LLM to get image descriptions. It utilizes `openai` along with `markitdown`. By passing an `llm_client` (OpenAI client in this example) and an `llm_model`, it instructs `markitdown` to get descriptions from a specified LLM using `md.convert()`. The output would be the image description generated by the large language model.

The "Docker" section shows how to work with `markitdown` using Docker:

* **Docker Build:** `docker build -t markitdown:latest .` builds a Docker image named `markitdown:latest` using the Dockerfile in the current directory.
* **Docker Run:** `docker run --rm -i markitdown:latest < ~/your-file.pdf > output.md` runs the container. The `< ~/your-file.pdf` redirects a specified PDF file to stdin and the container converts it to Markdown and outputs that to `output.md`.

In essence, this image is a mini-guide showing the diverse utility of the `markitdown` library – for document conversion and for advanced image processing – and how it can be used within a Docker environment, making it a flexible and robust solution for different text-processing tasks.

**Key elements highlighted in the caption:**

*   **Clarity:** Explains the purpose of the `markitdown` library and its functions.
