One reason programmers dislike meetings so much is that they're on a different
type of schedule from other people. Meetings cost them more.

There are two types of schedule, which I'll call the **manager's** schedule and
the **maker's** schedule. [^1]

Most powerful people are on the manager's schedule. It's the schedule of
command. But there's another way of using time that's common among people who
make things, like programmers and writers. They generally prefer to use time in
units of half a day at least. You can't write or program well in units of an
hour. That's barely enough time to get started.

For someone on the maker's schedule, having a meeting is like throwing an
exception. It doesn't merely cause you to switch from one task to another; it
changes the mode in which you work.
