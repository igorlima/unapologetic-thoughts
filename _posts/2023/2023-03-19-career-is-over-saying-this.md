The List [^1]

- "That's not my job"
  - If you keep saying that, you won’t have a job at all.
  - The reason for this is clear. Companies want people who get stuff done.
  - Talk to them about it but leave the work to them.
- "You dislike someone else on the project"
  - You’re acting like a child, and yet you don’t expect to be treated like one.
  - Nobody wants to be a schoolteacher. Nobody wants a complainer on the team.
- "Your cat got a cough"
  - __I...just...don’t...care__
    - Neither does no one. It just sounds like an excuse.
  - Sort your life out and bring your best self to work.
- "You're wrong"
  - No one wants to hear that they are wrong.


Things to say instead

Saying you need something is not a weakness, it helps the work get done. Which is BOTH yours and your manager’s job.

People appreciates that you wish to be successful in your job. They want you to succeed. In helping them, they help in return.
