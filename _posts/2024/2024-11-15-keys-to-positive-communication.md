These tips can help you start to inspire and influence the people around you. [^1]

- Greet to create human contact
  - The work of communication often starts with greeting, which is a simple but significant behavior: the moment when you initiate the process of making contact.
- Ask to discover the unknown
  - One way of improving your communication is to learn to flip your questions from closed-ended to open-ended.
- Compliment to affect people’s sense of self
  - Complimenting is just one behavior among many that illustrates our capacity for affecting people in a positive way.
- Disclose to deepen relationships
  - The way we go about enacting this sense of love and collegiality is by the act of disclosure: revealing how we think, how we feel, and who we are in an authentic way.
  - Pay attention to the feelings and thoughts going on inside of you—should I do it, should I not do it, how are they going to respond? Despite all that, in this moment you can choose to express your gratitude. That’s disclosure.
- Encourage to give support
- Listen to transcend differences
  - Listening can be uncomfortable, but there is a lot to learn if we quiet everything going on inside of us and turn our attention to other people.
