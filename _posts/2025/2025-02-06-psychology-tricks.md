These techniques are presented as effective yet potentially manipulative tools for influencing behavior in social interactions. [^1]

__The Power of Silence__: “Silence is one of the great arts of conversation.” – Marcus Tullius Cicero
- Silence makes people uncomfortable.
- They fill the gap, often with more information than they intended.

__The Ego-Bait Technique__: compliments can manipulate even the strongest people.
- We all crave validation. Even those who pretend they don't care? They care. I know I do. And if you tell someone what they want to hear their guard drops.
- “Flattery is like chewing gum. Enjoy it but don't swallow it.” – Hank Ketcham
- Compliments can be the backdoor to someone's mind. Use only if they're genuine enough to pass as believable.
  - Stroke their ego: Make them feel important.
  - Be sincere enough to be believable.
  - Compliments lower defenses, making people more receptive.
- People want to feel seen, to be heard. Stroke the ego just enough, and they'll give you what you want.

__Agree to Disagree__: the fastest way to change someone's mind isn't arguing with them.
- We all hate being wrong. It's an attack on our identity. So, when someone comes at us with facts, we put up walls, defend our ground, and shut them out.
- But what if, instead of attacking, you agree?
  - “A man convinced against his will is of the same opinion still.” – Dale Carnegie
- If you want to win people over, you first have to make them feel understood. Never to argue but instead acknowledge the other person's perspective.

__Mirror Like You Mean It__: Mimicking someone's body language can make them like you.
- "Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery." — Oscar Wilde
- You're showing them, without saying a word, that you're on the same page.
  - Mirror their posture: Not in a mocking way, but slowly.
  - Reflect on their tone and pace.

__The Underdog Manipulation__: Sometimes being the underdog isn't a disadvantage—it's leverage.
  - When you let others see a bit of your struggle, you'd be surprised how they react. They step in to help. They want to see you succeed.
  - When you present yourself as someone who's almost there but could use a boost, people naturally want to be the hero.
    - Show vulnerability, but don't overdo it.
    - Invite empathy, don't beg for pity.
    - People love helping the underdog.

__The Fear of Missing Out (FOMO)__: when we think something's about to disappear, we want it more. We think, what if I miss out?
  - FOMO can push people to act, sometimes irrationally, just to avoid that feeling.
    - Scarcity drives desire.
    - People hate being left out, even if they pretend not to care.

__The Confession Game__: if you confess something mildly negative about yourself first, the other person is more likely to trust you.
  - It sounds counterintuitive
    - But, When someone confesses something vulnerable, you feel closer to them. Like they're letting you in. So you reciprocate.
