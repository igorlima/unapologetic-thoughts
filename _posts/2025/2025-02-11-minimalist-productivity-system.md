The world is shifting from technicians to creators. [^1]

Technicians work toward the goals they are assigned. Creators cultivate a lifestyle that naturally results in the goals they choose.

The ancient Greeks saw rest as a great gift, both work and rest were necessary for a good life: one provided the means to live, the other gave meaning to life.

If you want to get things done, work. If you want to get the right things done, rest.

It's counterintuitive, but rest is how you get 6 years of work done in 6 months.

__Minimalism is not about having less, it's about making room for more of what matters.__

If you want rest, you have to take it, because nobody in this world is going to give it to you.

Rest is what allows your mind to filter signal from noise.

Your brain works for you when you rest.

Think of it like â€œshower thoughts".
