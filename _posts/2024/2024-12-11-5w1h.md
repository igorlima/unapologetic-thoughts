**5W1H** stands for the six fundamental questions used to gather complete information or solve a problem. It's a framework often used in journalism, investigation, project management, and problem-solving. The letters represent:

1. **Who** – Who is involved?
2. **What** – What happened or needs to be done?
3. **When** – When did it happen or will it happen?
4. **Where** – Where did it happen or will it happen?
5. **Why** – Why did it happen or why is it necessary?
6. **How** – How did it happen or how will it be done?

This method ensures a thorough analysis of any situation or task, providing a complete picture by covering all essential aspects.
