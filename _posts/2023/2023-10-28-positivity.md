title: How much positivity do we need?
category: inspiration

Here's where it gets interesting: it's not an amount; it's a ratio. 3 to 1. Three positive feelings for every negative one. (This ratio issue seems to be a pattern in human flourishing. Research shows the best work teams have six positive experiences for every negative and happy marriages have a 5 to 1 ratio.) [^1]

We don't need to delete all the negatives from life. Remember: it's 3 to 1, not 3 to 0. We learn from the negative and feel good because at the positive. We just have to keep the balance.
