Three uncomfortable ideas that might help: [^1]
- Reframe procrastination as a values problem, not a productivity problem
  - Our culture views procrastination negatively. However, it often signals an important message: you don't truly want what you say you want. While some tasks are unavoidable, chronic procrastination often concerns things we think we want, such as starting a new project, exercising, or dating. This could mean:
    - **You want to want it, but you don't.** You might tell yourself you want to do CrossFit, but deep down, you don't. Procrastination is your mind saying, **"Stop lying to yourself!"**
    - **You want it, but your reasons aren't clear enough.** Values motivate us, but only if they're specific. Abstract values like "creativity" won't motivate you to write a book. A clearer value, like "I feel most alive when I'm creative," is much more powerful. Working harder isn't the solution; you need to value the task.
  - **Ask yourself:** _Do I procrastinate because I'm lazy, or because I'm dishonest about my values?_
- Stop using self-criticism as motivation
- Get out of your head (and change your environment instead)
  - Chronic procrastination often stems from deeper psychological issues. However, your environment significantly impacts your psychology. Procrastinators often overestimate the importance of their mental state and underestimate their environment. Consider:
    - Is it junk food's allure or your environment that hinders you?
    - Is it a lack of discipline or an unsuitable work environment that stops your novel writing?
  - Think about your procrastination environment:
    - What could you remove to improve focus?
    - What could you add to your routine to ease the start?
    - Which people help/hinder your progress? How could you make your work easier or more enjoyable?
    - Are there better times or places to work?
  - Simple solutions might emerge, but implementing them may require effort (e.g., decluttering your garage, negotiating with your boss about remote work). Your environment matters profoundly. A significant environmental change might be what you need.

**All You Need to Know:**
1. Reframe procrastination as a values problem.
2. Stop using self-criticism as motivation.
3. Change your environment.
