title: Is AI Making Programmers Stupid?
category: inspiration
---

There has been a concern for a long time that Google has been making us stupid. Actually it didn’t start with Google. People have always been concerned that each new wave of technology was making us stupider, from the TV to the telegraph. Socrates famously worried that the written word would weaken people’s memory, as they would no longer need to memorize as much. [^1]
- The article argues that while past technologies like television and the telegraph have been blamed for making people dumber, AI represents a new threat due to its ability to generate complex content like code, essays, and even political arguments.
- The author argues that while previous technologies have been accused of making us "stupid," AI, specifically large language models (LLMs), poses a unique threat to our cognitive abilities.
- Andrew Zuo argues that AI-generated content, such as LLMs, can lead to a decline in programming skills due to excessive reliance on AI rather than critical thinking.
