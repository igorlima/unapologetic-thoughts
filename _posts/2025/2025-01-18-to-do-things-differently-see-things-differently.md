title: to do things differently, you have to see things differently

To see anything differently, you have to change how you see it. [^1]

You see what you expect. Everything you do starts with how you see the world. Action precedes beliefs. If you see obstacles, you act cautiously. If you see opportunities, you take risks. If you believe you’re unlucky, you’ll notice every bad thing that happens. You’ll ignore the good.

Don’t force reality to change. Change how you engage with it.

Two people can face the same event but react completely differently. Why? Because they see it differently.

You overlook things because your brain filters out what doesn’t fit your current worldview. It’s called selective attention.

You focus on what you believe matters and ignore the rest.

To do things differently, adjust your lens. Change your focus, challenge your beliefs, and take on new perspectives.
