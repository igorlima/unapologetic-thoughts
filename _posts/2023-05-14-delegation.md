__Delegate goals not tasks__ [^1]

Delegating tasks is relatively easy. “Please do __x__ by __y__ time”.

But it’s not going to make you great at delegating, or connecting people to the impact of doing the work — and that’s critical.

Instead, you have to give people the goal and the WHY? Why is this important? What does it mean for the team or the company?

You think the most important part of delegation is how you focus on your team. Nah, it’s your manager. Now, you don’t need to be perfect, you just have to show them WHY you’re delegating — yup, more context. So let them in on your plan.
