### Examples

**Example 1**
```
Start using Nautilus
x Finish a task by x
Change default task duration 60min
9:30-11am Add some fixed-time event
Recolor important task to red with !
16-17:20 Relax
Review what you accomplished
Click on Example 2
```

**Example 2**
```
[ ] Use brackets for tasks to add a typical markup
  This row is just a note â€“ Nautilus ignores 
  rows starting with two spaces
[x] Finish tasks by inserting the x
[ ] Control task progress by adding the indicator d50% 90m
  The task will be narrower and dotted. This one is half-done.
[ ] Click on the task in spiral! 60m
[x] Add a timestamp like d10:30 to a finished task
  The task will be grayed and anchored in the spiral at the 
  specified time.

15:35-16:15 Try: 24h as format works too
4:30-5pm Afternoon meeting with notes:

  ...and as you see, you can add empty lines too!
```
