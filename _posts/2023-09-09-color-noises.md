Much like the way light frequencies are categorized into colors, different blends of sound frequencies are categorized as distinct noise colors.

These color noises create a constant, neutral background sound while you sleep. Research says theyâ€™re like a buffer for your brain, masking any disruptive noises that might wake you up.

  - helps manage sleep disorders like insomnia
    - _the wide range of tones in White Noise resembles the sounds of fans, TV static, and airplanes. Studies have also shown that it can reduce ADHD symptoms_.
- __Brown Noise__
  - assists your transition to REM sleep
    - _the deeper and lower tones of Brown Noise have similar sound frequencies as those found in waterfalls, crashing waves, and rumbling thunder, and they may reduce symptoms of certain types of tinnitus_.
- __Green Noise__
  - may help you overcome sleep anxiety
    - _the soothing mid-range tones of Green Noise are reminiscent of heavy rain, ocean waves, and rustling trees, creating a calm and serene sleep environment_.
- __Pink Noise__
  - matches slow brain waves to improve sleep
    - _the relaxing low tones of Pink Noise evoke the sounds of light rain, wind, and rustling leaves. **Early research suggests it may also help boost your memory**_.
